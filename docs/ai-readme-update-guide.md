# AI README Update Guide

## Overview

This guide provides comprehensive instructions for creating and maintaining an excellent README.md file for your project. The README serves as the primary entry point for end-users and is crucial for project adoption and success.

## üö® CRITICAL: END-USER FOCUS ONLY

**MANDATORY RULE**: The README must ONLY contain information relevant to end-users who want to USE the project, not develop it.

### ‚ùå AVOID These Internal Details:
- Development setup for contributing to the project
- Internal testing procedures for the project itself
- Migration guides (unless the project is specifically a replacement tool)
- Internal implementation details
- Contributor development workflows
- Project maintenance procedures

### ‚úÖ INCLUDE End-User Content:
- How to install and use the project
- How to test applications that use the project
- How to configure the project for different use cases
- Performance considerations for production use
- Troubleshooting user issues
- Contributing guidelines (brief, with links to detailed guides)

## Purpose and Scope

### What a Great README Should Achieve

A top-notch README should:
- **Immediately communicate value**: Users should understand what the project does and why they need it within seconds
- **Provide quick wins**: Users should be able to get started successfully within minutes
- **Build confidence**: Clear examples and comprehensive documentation reduce friction
- **Support different user types**: From beginners to advanced users seeking specific features
- **Drive adoption**: Compelling presentation encourages usage and contribution

### Target Audience

The README targets several distinct user groups:
- **Elixir developers** looking for event sourcing solutions in the Ash ecosystem
- **Full-stack developers** building applications that need audit trails and event replay
- **Teams** evaluating event sourcing solutions for their specific needs
- **DevOps engineers** implementing event-driven architectures

**NOT the target audience**:
- Contributors who want to work on the project itself (they should read CLAUDE.md and other dev docs)
- Maintainers looking for internal procedures (they should read internal documentation)

## Content Structure and Guidelines

### Essential README Structure

All README files should follow this proven structure:

```markdown
# Project Title

Brief, compelling description (1-2 sentences)

## Why [Project Name]?

## Quick Start

Minimal working example (copy-paste ready)

## Installation

Quick installation instructions

## Usage

Comprehensive examples and patterns

## Configuration

- Demonstrate common use cases first
- Progress from simple to complex scenarios

**3. Comprehensive Coverage**
- Cover all major features and capabilities
- Include edge cases and gotchas
- Provide troubleshooting guidance
- Link to additional resources

**4. Professional Presentation**
- Use consistent formatting and style
- Include proper headings and organization
- Add visual elements (badges, diagrams) when helpful
- Maintain up-to-date information

## Project-Specific Guidelines

### Project Title and Description

**Title**: Should be clear and memorable
```markdown
# AshEvents

An extension for the Ash Framework that provides event capabilities for Ash resources, enabling complete audit trails and powerful event replay functionality.
```

**Description**: Expand on the value proposition
```markdown
AshEvents provides automatic event logging for Ash resources, ensuring complete audit trails and enabling powerful replay functionality. Track all changes, rebuild state from events, and handle schema evolution with version management.
```

### Installation Section

**Must Include**:
- Hex package configuration
- Required Elixir and Ash versions
- Database setup requirements

**Template**:
```markdown
## Installation

Add `ash_events` to your dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:ash_events, "~> 0.4.2"}
  ]
end
```

```

### Quick Start Section

**Critical Requirements**:
- Complete, working example
- Copy-paste ready code

**Template**:
```markdown
## Quick Start

1. **Create an Event Log Resource:**

```elixir

  use Ash.Resource,
    extensions: [AshEvents.EventLog]

  event_log do
    clear_records_for_replay MyApp.Events.ClearAllRecords
    primary_key_type Ash.Type.UUIDv7
    persist_actor_primary_key :user_id, MyApp.User
  end
end
```

2. **Add Event Tracking to Resources:**

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.User do
  use Ash.Resource,
    extensions: [AshEvents.Events]

  events do
    event_log MyApp.Events.Event
  end
end
```

3. **Use with Actor Attribution:**

```elixir
user = User
|> Ash.Changeset.for_create(:create, %{name: "John"})
|> Ash.create!(actor: current_user)
```
```

### Features Section

**Structure**:
- Lead with most compelling features

**‚ùå AVOID Migration Guides When**:
- Project is an addition to existing ecosystems (like AshEvents to Ash)
- No direct replacement relationship exists
- Migration would be project-specific and not generalizable

**AshEvents Specific**: AshEvents is an addition to Ash projects, not a replacement for other tools. Users ADD AshEvents to their existing Ash resources, they don't migrate FROM other tools TO AshEvents.

## Writing Process

### 1. Planning Phase (Use TodoWrite)

Create a comprehensive plan with these todos:
- Read current README.md structure and content
- Analyze user feedback and common questions
- Research competitor README files
- Identify missing content and improvement opportunities
- Plan new structure and content sections
- Draft core sections with examples
- Review and refine for clarity and completeness
- Validate all code examples and commands
- Test installation and quick start instructions

### 2. Content Development

**Start with Core Value Proposition**:
- What problem does AshEvents solve?
- Why should users choose it over alternatives?
- What makes it unique and valuable?

**Build Progressive Examples**:
- Start with simplest possible example
- Add complexity gradually
- Show complete, working code
- Include expected outputs

**Address Common Questions**:
- How does it work with existing Ash projects?

## Key Reminders for AshEvents

### Project-Specific Rules

1. **No Migration Guides**: AshEvents is an addition to Ash projects, not a replacement for other tools
2. **Testing Focus**: How to test applications that use AshEvents, not how to test AshEvents itself
3. **Performance Focus**: End-user production considerations, not internal implementation details
4. **Community Focus**: Contributing guidelines with links to detailed guides, not development setup

### Content Validation Questions

Before adding any section, ask:
- "Does this help end-users USE AshEvents in their applications?"
- "Is this about working ON the AshEvents project itself?"
- "Would a developer adding AshEvents to their Ash project need this information?"

If the answer to the first question is "no" or the second question is "yes", don't include it.
